/**
 * ACKS module code-hygiene sweep — the Workflow script.
 *
 * DO NOT run this file directly. `plan-sweep.mjs` bakes its plan into a
 * generated copy and prints that copy's path; run THAT:
 *
 *     node plan-sweep.mjs --lens foundry     # prints RUN: <path>
 *     Workflow({ scriptPath: "<that path>" })   // no args needed
 *
 * The plan is baked into the generated file rather than passed as `args`
 * because the payload is ~20 KB of JSON: routing it through a tool argument
 * means transcribing it by hand, and a single mangled character (an em dash, an
 * escaped ampersand, a stringified object) fails in a way that looks like the
 * script is broken. A file path cannot be mistranscribed.
 *
 * Passing `args` still works — the baked plan simply takes precedence — so a
 * caller that already holds the payload programmatically can use either.
 *
 * Shape of the return value:
 *   { rows, triageMarkdown, coverage, summary, vocab, sweptClusterIds,
 *     carriedClusterIds, mode, lens, heads, auditDir }

/* ------------------------------------------------------ shared context ---- */

const DOCTRINE_CONTEXT = `FAMILY DOCTRINE — this family of Foundry VTT modules has its own decided conventions. Judge against these first and generic best practice second; where a convention is silent on a recurring problem, or actively prescribes something wrong, that is a convention-gap finding.
- Reuse -> extend -> enhance -> invent. Reuse core system documents/fields; extend only via flags["<module-id>"]; enhance with alternate sheets/wrappers; invent nothing the system already provides.
- foundryvtt-acks-core is an UNMODIFIABLE reference. Overrides of core logic default to acks-extras/scripts/lib/. ONE OWNER PER WRAPPED CORE METHOD — two callers wrapping one core method in different directions is a known family failure mode already ruled against.
- Namespacing (validate-enforced): globalThis exposures / custom hooks / Handlebars helpers start with the camelCased module id (acksExtras, acksImporter); top-level CSS classes with the kebab module id; lang keys under the declared ACKS-* root(s); pack _ids with the declared idPrefix.
- Comments and docstrings, stated in each repo's own CLAUDE.md: comments explain MECHANICS — present tense, no dates, no attribution, no change history. Rulings and rejected alternatives go to DECISIONS.md, unbuilt work to ROADMAP.md. NO TODO/FIXME IN SOURCE is an explicit ban. Every exported symbol carries a docstring. A constraint stays in code as a present-tense rule; the incident that taught it goes to DECISIONS. Treat every existing comment as UNVERIFIED — they drift.
- Standing rules from shipped field failures (TOOLCHAIN §10), each canon because the family already paid for it:
  10a. Import a shared surface STATICALLY; never feature-detect a nested API path into silence. A probe for a function at the wrong nested path returns false forever and the layer behind it degrades invisibly. Runtime globalThis probing is only for OPTIONAL integrations, and must log once when absent so a wrong path cannot impersonate "not installed".
  10b. A missing timestamp means "never enrolled", not "since the epoch".
  10c. Automation never escalates its own failure into a punitive game consequence. A failed precondition stops and reports; punitive branches run only from an explicit GM action.
  10d. Every module that persists flags or Active Effects ships its uninstall path.
  10e. Cross-repo feature halves land dependency-first; a guarded read makes a missing half invisible rather than acceptable.
  10g. foundry.utils.duplicate() strips getters — a duplicated snapshot has _id but no id, and a lookup on the wrong key must not no-op silently.
- 2026-08-01 merge: eight modules became scripts/<feature>/ subsystems of acks-extras; acks-content became acks-importer. acks-importer requires acks-extras; extras must never name the importer.
- 2026-08-04: a shared check MUST report what it checked. A green run that verified nothing is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.`

const CORE_FLAW_CONTEXT = `CORE FLAW CONTEXT — foundryvtt-acks-core is read-only reference. Never report a finding against core itself; report only where THIS cluster repeats one of its patterns (category core-flaw-inherited).
1. Core defines a real frozen enum ITEM_TYPE in src/module/constants.mjs (item/weapon/armor/spell/ability/language/money/bundle) and then never imports it in documents/actor.mjs — 26 raw \`.type === "..."\` comparisons in that file, 44 across 13 files. CONFIG.ACKS (keys: statusEffects, scores, roll_type, saves_short, saves_long, armor, colors, proficiencyType, tags, tag_icons, tag_images, hireling_categories, item_subtypes, monster_saves, base_speed) does NOT carry ITEM_TYPE or the other frozen tables, so reaching them would mean importing core internals — itself against doctrine. Does this cluster compare type/subtype fields against raw literals where a local frozen enum belongs?
2. Core's own changelog records recurring bug classes worth re-checking here: an Active Effect applying twice / a value that grows on every re-apply; a migration/type mismatch surviving for versions; dead code left active enough to throw; a registered setting that gates nothing.
3. Core has NO empty catch blocks anywhere in src/module. Any empty or effectively-empty catch here is worse than the reference it builds on.`

const THEMING_CONTEXT = `THEMING CONTEXT — the family's single-publisher rule for light/dark seats.
- vendor/acks-design/tokens.css is the ONLY place --acks-* palette values are declared (:root plus one .theme-dark, [data-acks-theme="dark"] block). Every other stylesheet CONSUMES them.
- Consumers read tokens BARE: var(--acks-spot). A literal fallback — var(--acks-spot, #7b1e3c) — masks a missing token, which is how an undeclared token once shipped unnoticed. Treat any var(--acks-*, <literal>) as a finding.
- SURFACE vs INK: background takes --acks-burgundy; color and border take --acks-spot. They diverge on dark seats, so a mix-up is invisible in light mode and wrong in dark.
- Inherit-as-substituted: a token whose value contains var() freezes its substitution at <html>, and Foundry puts .theme-dark on <body>. So every DERIVED token (banner, rule-color, borders, focus-ring, shapes) is re-declared verbatim inside the dark block. Do NOT report that duplication as a duplicate-function or dead-code finding — it is load-bearing. Report the opposite: a derived token missing from the dark block.
- One font knob: the fontScale client setting pins --acks-fs-base on documentElement; all sizes derive from --acks-fs-*. A raw px font-size is a finding.
- v13+ cascade layers: manifest-declared module CSS already outranks system and core layers, so !important and specificity escalation against core styles are obsolete anti-patterns rather than necessary evils.`

const APPV2_CONTEXT = `APPLICATIONV2 CONTEXT — what this project's own modern shape looks like, taken from core's already-migrated sheets.
- Core's pattern: \`const { HandlebarsApplicationMixin } = foundry.applications.api; class X extends HandlebarsApplicationMixin(foundry.applications.sheets.ActorSheetV2)\`, with static DEFAULT_OPTIONS (including an actions map), static PARTS, static TABS + instance tabGroups, and overrides of _prepareContext / _preparePartContext / _onRender. Never getData, never activateListeners. Raw DOM (querySelector/addEventListener), not jQuery. Registration via foundry.documents.collections.Actors/Items.registerSheet(...).
- Both audited modules were surveyed and currently show ZERO legacy V1 hits. That is exactly why the legacy half of the appv2-v14-compat check stays in force permanently: it is a regression gate, not a discovery exercise. Report legacy patterns if you find them; report nothing if you do not.
- Legacy Application/FormApplication and V1 sheets are deprecated but functional through v15 and removed in v16 — so a legacy hit is "modernize before v16" (Medium), not "broken today" (High), unless something else makes it worse.
- Known live concerns to check rather than rediscover: (a) three files build their sheet class through a factory — \`return class X extends Base\` where Base comes from CONFIG.Item.sheetClasses[...] / CONFIG.Actor.sheetClasses.monster (abilities/ability-sheet.mjs, equipment/item-sheet.mjs, monsters/monster-sheet.mjs). Check that a failed or stale resolution fails LOUDLY rather than silently yielding a wrong base — this is §10a's shape applied to a class instead of a function. (b) AppV2 ships no automatic drag-and-drop; the framework helper is configured as DEFAULT_OPTIONS.dragDrop [{dragSelector, dropSelector}], instantiated in the constructor, bound in _onRender. Manual dragover/drop listener wiring rebuilds that plumbing by hand (render-granularity / library-reinvention). ESTABLISHED FACT (verified against v14 build 365, drag-drop.mjs:82-95): DragDrop#bind assigns handlers by IDL property (element.ondrop = ...), so per-render re-binding or re-instantiation OVERWRITES the previous handler — listeners never stack, drops never duplicate. Off-lifecycle DragDrop use is a convention finding (Medium at most), never a data-corruption Critical; do not re-derive an accumulation theory. (c) Partial rendering — this.render({parts:['x']}) — is the framework answer to a one-field change; a bare this.render() re-renders and re-lays-out everything.
- Context, not a target: core itself has NOT adopted DialogV2 and still uses jQuery in two non-sheet hook files. Do not file findings about core. It is noted so that extras' own consistent DialogV2 use reads as a deliberate improvement rather than an assumption.`

const LIBRARY_CONTEXT = `LIBRARY CONTEXT — extras declares lib-wrapper (>=1.12.0) and socketlib (>=1.1.0) in module.json relationships.requires.
- scripts/lib/sockets.mjs is the module's ONE socketlib transport, and is confirmed to be the only place in either repo touching game.socket. Its two internal game.socket.emit/on calls are a DELIBERATE, documented native fallback for when socketlib never came up, gated behind if (socket) / if (!socket). Do NOT report that dual path as a violation — it is the intended design.
- A confirmed finding already in hand, to CITE rather than re-derive: scripts/henchmen/repair.mjs (installWageGuard, around lines 123-156) raw-monkeypatches CONFIG.Actor.documentClass.prototype.getTotalWages — captures the original, substitutes a wrapper carrying a hand-rolled \`_<moduleId>Guarded\` reentrancy flag — instead of libWrapper.register(), which provides exactly that protection. It is structurally invisible to tools/validate-extra.mjs's "one libWrapper registration per target" gate, because that gate regexes the literal text libWrapper.register(. If your cluster owns that file, report it (library-reinvention, and note the lint blind spot for the convention-gap stage).
- Scope note, not a defect: acks-importer gates 20 operations on game.user.isGM and REFUSES for non-GMs rather than routing the write to a GM seat. That is why it declares neither library. Do not report it as a missing integration.`

HOW TO WORK
1. Read every assigned file (or line range) completely before judging anything. Do not skim, and do not judge a file you only partially read.
2. Emit one finding per real issue, with the exact relative file path, an exact line number or tight range, one category, a severity, a one-sentence summary, a concrete failure_scenario (specific state or input -> specific wrong outcome), the family convention it touches if any, and a brief concrete fix.
3. Severity: Critical = crash, data loss, or silently wrong game state a player or GM would experience (wrong dice result, wrong AC/HP, duplicated grants, money vanishing). High = a broken feature or wrong calculation the offline suite would not catch. Medium = a real robustness or maintainability risk not currently producing wrong behavior. Low = style, naming, or consistency only.
4. Precision beats volume. A finding whose line number is wrong is worse than no finding, because a verify pass has to spend a read to disprove it. Do not report something already correctly guarded, and do not report a two-value string comparison as magic-string-typing when an enum would be genuine overkill.
5. Most categories will legitimately find nothing here. Report only what you can point at.`

1. Open each cited file at each cited line. Confirm the code there actually supports the claim.

   verdict "adjusted" — the point is real but the line, severity, or category was wrong; return your corrected version and say what you changed in verify_note.
   verdict "rejected" — the citation does not support the claim, or on a closer read it is not a problem (correctly guarded elsewhere, deliberate documented design, a false positive against one of the CONTEXT blocks above); return it with verdict rejected and a verify_note explaining why.
3. Every candidate must appear exactly once in "verified" — never silently drop one.
4. In "added", include up to 6 genuine findings the first pass missed, strictly inside this cluster's files, same shape (no verdict needed). Do not pad this; an empty array is a fine answer.

FINDINGS FROM THE SWEEP (JSON):
${JSON.stringify(deduped, null, 2)}

Report convention gaps in BOTH senses, and label which each one is:
(a) SILENCE — a flaw class these findings keep hitting that canon has no rule about. Cite how many findings support it. Example shape: if magic-string-typing recurs heavily, canon has no rule requiring enum-based type comparison; that absence is the finding.
(b) WRONG DIRECTIVE — canon actively prescribes something that runs against best practice. Look hard for these; they are the more valuable half and easy to miss because canon reads authoritatively. One candidate to evaluate on the merits, not to rubber-stamp: TOOLCHAIN §10a tells code to import a shared surface statically "a junction-safe ../../<repo>/scripts/… across the one family edge", i.e. a relative ESM import reaching into another package's internals — while general Foundry package guidance says never relative-import across packages and to consume a published api surface instead. Decide whether §10a is right for this family's junction-based setup or whether it is entrenching fragile coupling, and say which and why.
Also flag any canon rule that is stated but structurally unenforceable, where the sweep found the gate has a blind spot.

For each gap, propose the concrete rule the family should adopt, written in canon's own terse declarative present tense.
