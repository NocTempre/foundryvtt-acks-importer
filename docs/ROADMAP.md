# Roadmap

Designed but not built. Anything here is deliberately absent from the code, not
missing from it.

## Cross-book merging beyond the current signals

Families merge today on a shared member id or a shared family suffix. Entries
that are the same creature under different names in two books — with neither
signal — still import as twins. A chef-authored alias would close it; the
question is whether that belongs in the register or in the binding.

---

## Locators for gear values

Cost, weight, weapon damage and armour AC currently fall back to the system's
defaults, with the printed table governing and the entry marked unaudited. No
chef-authored locators ship for them yet.

The pattern is proven — the defence and effect scans already do exactly this, and
`powerValue` was moved onto it — so this is authoring work, not design work.

---

## The earthforger's sigils and the sporecaster's mutations as choices

Both classes offer a pick the way the warlock's Dark Path does: the sigil (and
the mutation menu at 9th) is a player choice among printed options. Today one
definition anchors the family and the award notes say the choice is the
player's; the options themselves are prose. Modeling each option as its own
selectable entry — and surfacing the pick through the extras chooser — follows
the same route the warlock and witch tradition paths are waiting on.

---

## Gnostic invocations as documents

The Earthforger and Furnacewife casting entries carry the gnosis kind and the
Maximum Invocation Level ladder, but their invocation lists (BTA ch.5) are not
imported as documents — matching the RR classes, whose spell lists are also
empty on the casting entry. When spell-list references land for the vancian
classes, the invocation lists should ride the same mechanism.
