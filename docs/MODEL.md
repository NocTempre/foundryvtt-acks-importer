# Content Streamer (PoC) — Design Model

How this module applies the family doctrine **reuse → extend → enhance →
invent**:

- **Reuse**: which core `acks` documents, fields, and methods it builds on.
- **Extend**: genuinely new data, stored in `flags["acks-content"]` (typed by
  an in-memory DataModel where practical; blank numerics are `null`, never 0).
- **Enhance**: alternate sheets, libWrapper wraps, socketlib GM routing.
- **Invent**: kept to nothing the system already provides.

## Decisions

### The refresh bridge: bytes may cross a reload, and nothing longer (2026-07-29)

**Problem.** The possession model persists a book's *location*, never the book.
Three location kinds existed, and only two could reopen themselves: a
`FileSystemFileHandle` (one permission click) and a fetchable `url` (silent).
Both are out of reach for the seat that needs them most — the File System
Access API does not exist outside a secure context, so a player on plain
`http://` over the LAN, and every Firefox seat regardless of origin, fell to the
`file` kind: the remembered *name* of a PDF and nothing else. That seat re-picked
every book through the OS file dialog on every page load, and a Foundry client
reloads constantly.

**Rejected: caching the PDF per seat.** IndexedDB is the only store not gated on
a secure context, so a durable byte cache is the only thing that would have made
a remote seat reconnect with no gesture at all. It was rejected because it
quietly converts "you must keep the book" into "you must have had the book
once": the cache outlives the file, and the module's central claim stops being
true.

**Taken: a 60-second window, measured from when the page went away.** The bytes
of an *already open* book are held in IndexedDB and are readable only while a
`touched` stamp — refreshed every 20s by a live page, and once more on
`pagehide` — is inside the window. Every join sweeps first: inside the window,
books reopen silently; outside it, the bytes are deleted before anything else
runs. `Forget Books` and setting the window to `0` both empty it immediately.

The stamp is deliberately not written at connect time. Measured from the
connect, an hour of play would leave the window long expired at exactly the
reload it exists to cover, which is the whole failure it addresses.

Three properties of that stamp are load-bearing, and 0.61.0 shipped with all
three wrong — the bridge never once fired on a real refresh. Recorded because
each is invisible until tested against an actual reload:

1. **The stamp lives in localStorage, not IndexedDB.** It is written from
   `pagehide`, and an async IndexedDB transaction opened there never commits —
   the page is destroyed first. Measured directly: the localStorage write lands
   every time, the IndexedDB write lands never. With the async write silently
   lost, the freshest stamp was whatever the 20s heartbeat last managed.
2. **The comparison is against `performance.timeOrigin`, not "now".** Foundry
   takes 20–45s to reach `ready`, so comparing at `ready` charged the reader's
   window for the boot they had just sat through — a 60s window bought perhaps
   fifteen, and a slower world bought none. The question is "how long was this
   seat away?", which is timeOrigin minus stamp and nothing else.
3. **A slightly negative gap is the normal case, not clock drift.** A reload
   records the incoming document's `timeOrigin` *before* the outgoing page is
   given `pagehide`, so an ordinary refresh yields a gap a few milliseconds
   below zero. A `gap >= 0` guard therefore rejected every single refresh. Only
   a stamp more than `CLOCK_TOLERANCE_MS` ahead means the clock actually moved.

Worth stating plainly: the byte cache was never the fragile part. An
FSA-derived `File` stored in IndexedDB was verified to survive a reload and
read back byte-identical. Every failure was in deciding *whether* to use it.

What this does and does not concede: a reload is not a new session, so bridging
it enforces nothing less than before. A *session* still cannot begin without the
reader's own file. Nothing is uploaded, nothing enters world data, no other seat
can read it, and prose remains memory-only everywhere.

**Also:** where a gesture is still required, it is now one gesture for the whole
shelf. A plain file picker grants no persistent permission and so consumes no
user gesture (unlike `requestPermission` on a handle, which is why the per-book
rows exist at all), so a seat re-picking two or more books gets a single
multi-file control that matches files to books by remembered name → remembered
size → the book's title in the filename. Unmatched files are named, never
guessed at: a book filled from the wrong PDF is worse than a book left closed.

### Dialogs are singletons (2026-07-29)

`connectBook()` and the reconnect pass are each reachable from more than one
place — a macro, the Getting Started button, the join hook — and none of them
checked whether their dialog was already open. Every extra call stacked another
identical window, so a reader who clicked "Connect your book" twice got two book
pickers, two dropdowns listing the same six books, and two chances to read the
same PDF into the same slot. Both now register a key *synchronously*, before
their async content build, and a second call brings the open dialog forward
instead.
