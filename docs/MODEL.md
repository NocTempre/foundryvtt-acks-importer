# Content Streamer (PoC) — Design Model

How this module applies the family doctrine **reuse → extend → enhance →
invent**:

- **Reuse**: which core `acks` documents, fields, and methods it builds on.
- **Extend**: genuinely new data, stored in `flags["acks-importer"]` (typed by
  an in-memory DataModel where practical; blank numerics are `null`, never 0).
- **Enhance**: alternate sheets, libWrapper wraps, socketlib GM routing.
- **Invent**: kept to nothing the system already provides.
