# OSE — importing another game's books

How a Judge's own OSE or B-X adventure becomes ACKS II documents. The shipped
cookbook and its authoring pipeline are [COOKBOOK.md](COOKBOOK.md) and
[RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md); this is the fourth surface, and the only one whose
source books nobody has authored recipes for.

## Two ways a book is read

**Most books have no recipe, and never will.** There are thousands of OSE
adventures, and a source with no cookbook is registered by the Judge, in the
world, and never shipped. What ships for those is the procedure — a grammar for
the stat-block dialect, the arithmetic that turns its numbers into ACKS ones,
and the gates that stop either from guessing. That path reads about nine blocks
in ten with no authoring at all.

**A named few are authored and shipped.** Where a title is worth taking to
completion it gets a cookbook like an ACKS book: boxes the grammar could not
find on its own, plus the prose, tables and art that geometry can reach and a
stat-block reader cannot. The list is a deliberate IP ruling rather than an open
door — see DECISIONS, "Third-party books get shipped cookbooks".

Both are the same pipeline. **An authored entry supplies the BOX; the shipped
grammar still does the reading** — so a rule the corpus teaches improves the
authored books too, and an authored book can never drift into a private dialect
of its own.

## The modules

| Module | Job | Pure? |
|---|---|---|
| [`ose-blocks.mjs`](../scripts/ose-blocks.mjs) | find candidate stat blocks on a page | yes |
| [`ose-statline.mjs`](../scripts/ose-statline.mjs) | read one block, in OSE's own idiom | yes |
| [`ose-convert.mjs`](../scripts/ose-convert.mjs) | turn that into ACKS values | yes |
| [`ose-source.mjs`](../scripts/ose-source.mjs) | the Judge's source registry | world state |
| [`ose-binding.mjs`](../scripts/ose-binding.mjs) | build the actor | Foundry |
| [`ose-app.mjs`](../scripts/ose-app.mjs) | the Judge-facing dialogs | Foundry |
| [`ose-manual.mjs`](../scripts/ose-manual.mjs) | converting a block by hand | Foundry |

The first three touch neither Foundry nor a PDF, which is why almost all of the
behaviour is checked offline — `test-ose-blocks`, `test-ose-statline`,
`test-ose-convert`, `test-ose-binding` and `test-ose-manual`.

## The flow

Five entry points on `game.modules.get("acks-importer").api` (also
`globalThis.acksImporter`):

| Call | Does |
|---|---|
| `oseRegister()` | pick the PDF, name it, choose its ruleset |
| `oseImport(sourceId?)` | choose a registered adventure and a page |
| `oseCalibrate(sourceId, page)` | teach this book a label spelling it alone uses |
| `oseConvertAll()` | fill the axes that were waiting on the guide |
| `oseManual()` | paste, correct or type a block with no PDF at all |

The review step is the point of the flow. Nothing imports on the strength of a
pattern match: the Judge sees the block as printed, what each value converted to
and on whose authority, and every axis the converter refused — and then decides.
A candidate marked as another game's block, or as two creatures read as one,
**cannot be ticked at all**; importing either produces a confident wrong answer
rather than an obvious failure.

Source PDFs are session-only, exactly as the shipped books are. What persists is
the Judge's registry entry: a name they typed, the LINE they said it belongs to,
a page count, the label spellings they confirmed, and the boxes they imported
from.

## Where the imports land

Another game's creatures do not share a shelf with the ACKS ones. Each SERIES
gets its own set of compendia — `ACKS Cookbook — Dolmenwood — Actor` beside
`ACKS Cookbook — Actor` — and inside, a folder per book: `Creatures`,
`Templates` for the generators, `Areas` for keyed rooms with the adventure at
the top.

A shipped book names its series in `books.mjs` (`line`). A registered source
names its own, typed by the Judge at registration and offered from what this
world already shelves — the module cannot know who published a file it has
never seen, and asking is the only honest way to find out. A source that names
none goes to a shared shelf with the rest of the Judge's own books, as does a
block typed in with no source at all.

The line is derived from the document's own cookbook id, which is what makes it
safe: the same function answers for the write and for the "have I imported this
already?" read, so a creature can never be filed on one shelf and looked for on
another. See DECISIONS, "Another game's books get their own shelf".

## The conversion instrument

ACKS II publishes the arithmetic in its **System Compatibility Guide**, which is
a book id (`scg`) like any other. The rule ships; the constants do not — they
are read off the Judge's own page 2 by
[`scg-constants.mjs`](../scripts/scg-constants.mjs) and handed to the converter
as arguments. `tools/validate-extra.mjs` §3 fails the build if a number that
could be one of them appears in the converter.

**Staged, not gated.** Without the guide an import still produces actors: name,
hit points, saving throws, movement, morale and alignment need no arithmetic.
Armour class and attack throw are reported as gaps and filled later by
`convertUnconvertedOse`, so a Judge can import an adventure today and buy the
guide next week.

## Dialect is per source

The canonical OSE labels ship. A book that heads its hit dice differently gets a
**profile row on its own source record**, confirmed by the Judge — never a
widened shared grammar. Widening is how one verified reading of one book becomes
an unverified claim about every book nobody has opened; see DECISIONS.

A SHIPPED book says the same thing in `books.mjs`: `profile` names an entry in
`PROFILES`, `lineage` names a row in `LINEAGES`. Both default to OSE, so a book
declaring neither is read exactly as before. The Dolmenwood Monster Book is the
first to use them — `ose.dolmenwood` and lineage `dolmenwood` — and the profile
is what the harvester LOCATES it with too, since the labels a profile adds are
what make its blocks countable as blocks.

The lineage exists separately from the profile because of the armour class. A
lone "AC 14" is valid in both dialects and means opposite things; the grammar
reports the printed figure and marks the block `bare`, and the lineage decides
which progression it belongs to.

### An unknown label ends the clause

A label the profile does not know still bounds the clause before it, and is
reported under the word the page printed. Without that, an unfamiliar dialect is
not reported as unfamiliar — it is absorbed into its neighbour, `extra` comes
back empty, and the sweep calls the block perfectly understood. So a leftover
naming a label is the grammar asking for a profile row, and the row can be
written straight off the report.

## What is refused rather than converted

Three things the locator marks instead of importing:

- **A block from another game** (`suspectLineage`) — ascending armour class with
  no descending counterpart, ability modifiers rather than scores, range bands
  instead of rates. Read as OSE, its armour class inverts silently.
- **Two blocks read as one** (`mergedBlocks`) — a doubled armour-class label.
  Happens where a narrow block is set inside a prose column, a sub-column the
  page-wide histogram cannot see.
- **An unsupported lineage** — the converter returns nothing and says why.

## What reaches the actor

Everything. An axis that converts becomes an ACKS field; an axis that does not
is a **gap** — the ACKS field is left at its schema default and the printed
value is kept. Both, plus the block as extracted, the grammar's reading, and the
route and citation behind every converted value, live under
`flags["acks-importer"].ose` and are shown on the monster sheet's **Source** tab
(acks-extras; contract in that repo's `docs/lib/API.md`).

Per-axis mapping, and which axes are gaps, is in the plan of record and in
`test-ose-convert.mjs`, which asserts every one of them.

## Converting by hand

The automatic path needs a PDF it can read. A scanned adventure has no text
layer, a block the locator refused is one it could not vouch for, and a creature
from a blog post or the Judge's own head was never in a book. `oseManual()` is
the same pipeline with the page taken out: paste a block and it is read, correct
whatever it got wrong, convert. Or type it from nothing and skip the reading.

**Each field holds its clause in the source game's own idiom** — `9 [10]`,
`1** (4hp)`, `D13 W14 P13 B16 S15 (Magic-user 1)` — and converting reassembles
them into a stat line and runs the ordinary grammar over it. A widget per parsed
value would have been easier and would have frozen the editor at whatever the
grammar understood the day it was written. As built, every rule the parser ever
learns reaches hand entry the moment it reaches the parser, with no work here:
`test-ose-manual.mjs` asserts that the two paths produce identical output from
the same block.

### What the world has learned

A pasted block is read with **every label spelling calibrated on any registered
source**, not only the canonical set, and the editor names which spelling fired
and which book taught it.

This is not the same as the per-source rule, and the difference matters. A BOOK
is read with its own profile and nothing else, because one book's wording
silently changing how another parses is the failure that rule exists to prevent.
Pasted text belongs to no book: there is no reading to corrupt, the Judge sees
the result in an editable form before anything is created, and the reader says
where each learned spelling came from. So knowledge accumulates where it is safe
to — calibrate one adventure's `HIT DICE` today and every pasted block
understands it from then on.

### Provenance

A hand-converted creature carries the same record as an imported one, with
`origin: "hand"`, no page and no box. The Source tab reads it unchanged.

## Improving the grammar

A block that has to be corrected by hand is a **defect report against the
parser**, not a case the manual editor exists to absorb. The editor is there so
a Judge is never stuck; the misreading is still meant to become a rule.

```bash
node tools/ose-coverage.mjs                 # every book in the library
node tools/ose-coverage.mjs --book carcass  # one title
node tools/ose-coverage.mjs --samples       # one real clause per finding
```

It sweeps the local OSE library named by `LIB_OSE` in `tools/reference-lib.mjs`
— LOCAL-ONLY, whatever the machine's owner owns — and ranks what the grammar
could not read. Take the top line, write the rule, run it again. The number to
move is the share of blocks read completely.

**Findings are SHAPES, not values.** Every digit run folds to `#`, so
`HIT DICE 2 (9hp)` and `HIT DICE 11 (48hp)` are one finding, and the report
carries no publisher's numbers. It prints to stdout and writes nothing — a
coverage file in the repo would be a corpus of other publishers' stat lines in a
tracked file.

### What the sweep is for

Two things, and the second is the surprising one.

It finds **wordings the grammar has never seen** — `Hit Dice` for `HD`, `Saves`
for `SV`, B/X's own `D R H B S` save letters. A wording several unrelated
publishers use is the family's rather than one book's, and that evidence is what
promotes it from a per-source profile into the canonical set (see DECISIONS).

It also finds **bugs in rules already written**, which no amount of staring at
three sample books will. The two largest findings in the first full sweep were
both from the same earlier rule: the residue cut severed a group's hit points at
the comma inside `(hp 4, 6, 7)`, and severed every thousands separator in the
corpus — 141 times across 22 books, presenting as an unexplained bare number.

### A partial reading is worse than none

The alternate save letters did not fail loudly. `SV D12 R13 H14 B15 S16` matched
three of five and quietly produced a creature with three saving throws, the rest
at their defaults with nothing to mark the difference. A row is now accepted
only when its letters make up a complete known set; anything else is reported as
a gap. When a rule is added here, prefer refusing to guessing — a gap is visible
on the Source tab and a wrong number is not.

### Where it stands

Last full sweep: **1239 blocks across 93 books, 74% read completely** from the
text alone, reading every book as canonical OSE.

That number went DOWN from a reported 90%, and the drop is the measurement
getting honest rather than the grammar getting worse. Until an unknown label
bounded a clause, one absorbed the other and the sweep called the result a clean
read; the 90% was counting swallowed text as understood. Nothing was fixed by
finding this, and nothing was broken by it — the same blocks read the same way.
Only the report changed.

What the honest report says is that the largest remaining gap is **one dialect,
not a long tail**: "Morale" appears 228 times across ten books and "Speed" 202
times across nine. Those are Dolmenwood-line books, and the dialect that reads
them now ships. A source calibrated with `extends: "ose.dolmenwood"` starts from
it; `dmb` uses it directly.

The two halves are still meant to add up. The grammar reads what publishers
write in common; a wording only one book uses is calibrated onto that book; and
anything the geometry will not vouch for is offered to the hand editor rather
than refused. **Every block the sweep finds is reachable**, whether or not the
parser could read it — that is the number that has to be 100%, and the 74% is
how much of it happens without a person.

### A creature the book states as a range

Some entries are not one creature. Eleven Referee's Tome entries print
`HD 3 to 8` in a single block; twenty-one Dolmenwood retainers print a block per
level. Both become **generator actors** (`acks-extras.template`) with one axis,
rather than a creature frozen at the bottom of its own range or three unrelated
monsters that share a name.

What each route may claim differs. A group of entries derives nothing — every
option is its own printed block. A printed range transcribes the hit points for
each step, and fills the attack throw between the printed ends only when the
bonus divides evenly across the range; where it does not, those steps carry no
throw and the gap says why. See DECISIONS.

### The authored books

Eleven third-party books ship a cookbook: **483 creature entries, 96% read
completely**, each with the page it came from and the block as printed. 120
carry the book's own illustration — a bestiary illustrates a subset of what it
lists, and a creature the page never drew has none rather than a neighbour's.

    qd1 100%   qd2 100%   qd3 100%   aft  98%   dmb  90%   wld1-3 100%
    pc1  95%   pc2  86%   pc3  88%

They are imported by **"import everything"**, like everything else the module
ships: its OSE step walks every authored book this seat has open, taking each
book's creatures and then the keyed areas that are numbered against them, and
saying nothing at all about books the seat does not have. `oseImportBook` and
`oseImportAreas` remain on the api for one book at a time.

Which entry a document IS decides whether a second run builds it again, so an
authored import stamps the ENTRY id — `aft.woollyRhinoceros`, `qd3.area5` — and
asks for it before it reads the page. A book already imported costs one index
lookup per entry and creates nothing. A generator built from several entries is
stamped with its group under its book (`dmb.group.bard`), because group keys are
bare words that repeat from book to book; an adventure with `<book>.adventure`.
The registered-source and by-hand paths have no entry to name and keep the
page-derived id, which cannot tell two blocks on one page apart — they are the
paths a Judge drives a block at a time, and they are not deduplicated.
