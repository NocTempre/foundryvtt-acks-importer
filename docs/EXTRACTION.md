# The PDF extraction toolchain — map and gotcha ledger

The one page an extraction task reads first. The pipeline's *principles*
(scans locate / recipes interpret, the audit gate, chef tiers) are
[RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md); the *schema* is [COOKBOOK.md](COOKBOOK.md); the
*rulings* with their evidence are [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). This page is
the map of what runs, and the ledger of how PDFs fight back. Per-book
physical observations (typography, art, staged paths) are LOCAL-ONLY:
`C:\Proj\acks-rules\acks-content\BOOK-NOTES.md`.

## The map

**Extraction engine (`scripts/`):** `extract.mjs` (pdf.js text extraction:
glyph runs, double-strike dedup, column detection), `table-extract.mjs` (row
binding, run joining), specialized extractors (`armor-tables`,
`weapon-tables`, `gear-prices`, `language-binding`, `builder-binding`,
`stats`/`stats-map`), `book-match.mjs` (entry location by normalized
heading), `executor.mjs` (runs compiled cookbook ops against the reader's
own book at runtime), `cookbook.mjs` + `recipes.mjs`/`table-recipes.mjs`
(the compiled program and its recipe layer).

**Pipeline operators (`tools/`):**

| Stage | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Harvest | `harvest-page`, `harvest-index`, `harvest-conversions`, `dev-extract-check` |
| Register & recipes | `seed-entries`, `merge-recipes` (gate: re-executes every proposed recipe against the PDFs and rejects what does not materialize), `promote-candidates`, `promote-icons`, `build-chefdb` (SQLite view for chefs) |
| Audit | `audit-dump` (per-entry package for chefs), `audit-transcription`, `verify-cookbook`, `check-cookbook-drift`, `verify-against-compendium`, `lint-register`, `ledger-init` |
| Debug | `find-anchor`, `probe-table`, `dump-entry` |
| Gates | `check-prose-boxes` (a definition's prose must come from its own column), `test-*.mjs` executor suite, `test-cookbook-coherence`, `ip-scan` |
| Ship | `compile-cookbook` (register → shipped cookbook; per-book typography dispatch lives here) |

**The oracle:** `C:\Proj\acks-reference\WIKI-SNAPSHOT\` validates extracted
*structure* (column counts, row boundaries) — order and caveats in the synced
`.claude/rules/rules-lookup.md` and the snapshot's own README. Compare
`cookbook/*.json` (compiled ops), never `register/rr/*.json`.

**The chef kitchen (LOCAL-ONLY):** `C:\Proj\acks-rules\acks-content\` —
`PIPELINE.md` (prep/chef/architect tiers), `AUDIT_CHEF.md` (chef doctrine:
`assists` geometry overrides, locator rules, read `runs` before writing any
pattern).

## Extractor gotcha ledger

A running list: symptom → cause → where the fix or gate lives. **Add a row
whenever an extraction defect is diagnosed** — the row is a pointer, the
mechanics stay in the code comment, the ruling (if one was made) in
DECISIONS.md. Rows are never deleted; a superseded row says so.

| Symptom | Cause | Fixed / gated at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headings read doubled ("eencountersncounters") | Faux-bold paints the glyph twice at the same coordinates | `scripts/extract.mjs` double-strike dedup (drop exact str,x,y duplicates) — must behave identically in compiler and runtime |
| A definition's prose comes from the wrong column | Sparse pages starve the column histogram (detector returns price-list edges instead of true columns) | `assists.columns` per-entry override; gate `tools/check-prose-boxes.mjs`; ruling in DECISIONS.md ("better detectors" rejected — they trade page sets) |
| Entry text carries stray margin letters, or loses real superscript ordinals | Margin tab glyphs vs superscript ordinals — both are small runs near an edge | Position rule (tab sits OUTSIDE the trimmed margin, ordinal ON a line; extent from body-height runs) — DECISIONS.md |
| An entry's tail is cut mid-sentence at a page boundary | Column-turn logic followed column turns but not page turns; subheading heuristics mis-fire on wrapped lines | Alone-on-line + face + body-size test; `assists.flowColumns` for continuation pages — DECISIONS.md |
| Price grid reads the wrong figure, or "1, 500gp" splits | Long names bleed into the price column; thousands separators split across runs | `scripts/gear-prices.mjs` (bled price wins; NAME_GAP; separator re-join) |
| A locator pattern matches the package but not the compiler (or vice versa) | Audit packages join runs WITH spaces, the compiler WITHOUT — and display capitals split mid-word ("P"+"ROFICIENCIES") | Locator doctrine: `\s*` between every word, read `runs` first — AUDIT_CHEF.md |
| Wiki-snapshot text won't fuse across inline tags ("II.1Character Templates") | The HTML extractor inserts a space at tag boundaries | WIKI-SNAPSHOT `tools/extract.py` + its README caveats |
| A geometry override half-applies | `assists.descStopY` suppresses column flow by PRESENCE, not value | AUDIT_CHEF.md known-gotcha list |
| Superscript ordinals fuse into words | joinRuns superscript-ordinal artifact | Noted in the abilities program (acks-content/ABILITIES_PLAN.md); check before writing prose patterns |
