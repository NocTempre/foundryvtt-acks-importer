/**
 * A keyed area arrives as a PLACE, and its words stay in the reader's book.
 *
 * Two things this guards. The binding must produce an `acks-extras.location`
 * actor rather than a journal page — a place in this family has a parent, a
 * roster and contents, and prose can never grow those. And the room's text must
 * be a lazy tag, never stored: an area whose description was written into the
 * document would be book text shipped in a world file.
