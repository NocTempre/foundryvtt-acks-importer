/**
 * DEV-ONLY (chef-side): seed an authored OSE book's register from the locator.
 *
 * A cookbook entry for a creature is a BOX and a name. The locator already
 * finds most of them — 93% of the corpus at last sweep — so for an authored
 * book the boxes do not need typing out: this walks the book, takes every
 * candidate the locator is confident about, and writes the register rows.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT emit is the part that needs judgement:
 * - a candidate the locator flagged (another game's block, or two read as one)
 *   is REPORTED and skipped, because a box drawn around the wrong thing is
 *   worse than no box at all;
 * - prose and art boxes are left for the chef, since which paragraph belongs
 *   to which creature is a reading of the page, not a measurement of it.
 *
 * So the output is a floor, not a finished register: it turns "author 565
 * entries" into "review 565 boxes and hand-author the few dozen the locator
 * could not see". Re-running is safe — existing rows are kept by id and only
 * new ones are added, so a chef's hand edits survive.
 *
 * IP: emits geometry and a name, never values or prose. The name comes from
 * the book's own heading, which is a locator, and is capped like every other
 * register string.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/harvest-ose-book.mjs qd1            report only
 *   node tools/harvest-ose-book.mjs qd1 --write    write register/qd1/
 *   node tools/harvest-ose-book.mjs qd1 --pages 8-9

 *
 * - a bestiary that sets descriptive prose large enough to pass for a heading,
