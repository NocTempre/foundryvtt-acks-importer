/**
 * `parseEquipment` — splitting a template's printed Starting Equipment cell.
 *
 * The cell is prose written by a human for humans, and every class's author
 * punctuated it their own way. What this pins is the SPLITTING: where one item
 * ends and the next begins, which separators count, and which do not. What each

 * whatever the case under test needs.
 *
 * No book text is reproduced. The cells below are shaped like the printed ones —
