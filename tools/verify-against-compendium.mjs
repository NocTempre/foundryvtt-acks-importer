/**
 * Cross-check the register against the SYSTEM'S SHIPPED COMPENDIUMS.
 *
 * The acks system ships hand-built compendiums (119 proficiencies, 21 class
 * powers, 53 monster abilities). This module does not import them — content
 * comes from the reader's own book — but they are an independent list of what
 * ACKS content exists, built by different people from the same books. That
 * makes them a free correctness check on the register: a proficiency the system
 * knows about and the register does not is a gap worth explaining, and a
 * general/class flag the two disagree on is a fact one of them has wrong.
 *
 * ADVISORY ONLY — exit 0 whatever it finds (see docs: scans locate, recipes
 * interpret; a difference is a question for a chef, not a build failure). It
 * reports NAMES AND FLAGS, never book text, so it carries no licensed content.
 *
 * Three findings:
 *   - in the compendium, absent from the register  (a possible gap, or a
 *     rename/split the alias file should record)
 *   - in the register, absent from the compendium  (usually ACKS II content
 *     postdating the pack — but also catches entries that are not abilities
 *     at all, e.g. a section heading harvested as a proficiency)
 *   - general/class disagreements                  (one of the two is wrong)
 *
 * Renames and splits are NOT guessed. Two mechanical folds are applied because
 * they are structural conventions rather than rules judgements:
 *   - "Craft: Bowyer" -> "Craft"    (the pack splits by discipline; the
 *     register carries one entry plus acks-abilities `selections`)
 *   - punctuation/case folding
 * Everything else belongs in tools/compendium-aliases.json, authored
 * by a chef who has read both. Unaliased differences simply stay reported.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/verify-against-compendium.mjs [--json]
