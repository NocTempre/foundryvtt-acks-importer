/**
 * Cookbook staleness gate: is the committed `cookbook/` actually what the
 * current `register/` compiles to?
 *
 * The cookbook is a BUILD ARTIFACT that is also committed and shipped, so the
 * two can silently disagree: edit a register entry, forget `npm run compile`,
 * and the release carries an artifact from an older register. Nothing detected
 * that. It has already bitten once — v0.15.0 shipped a proficiencies.json whose
 * `def.prof.layingOnHands` was missing the `meta.provides` the alias-linking
 * pass sets on an alias target, so a gate written against `kw:layingonhands`
 * was not satisfied by holding Laying on Hands itself.
 *
 * The check is a recompile into a scratch dir and a byte compare. It is not a
 * determinism test — the compiler is deterministic, which is what makes an
 * inequality mean "stale" rather than "noisy".
 *
 * Requires the LOCAL reference PDFs, so it SKIPS (exit 0) wherever they are
 * absent — CI included. It is a pre-push gate for the machines that can author,
 * not a CI gate; tools/lint-register.mjs remains the PDF-free check that runs
 * everywhere.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/check-cookbook-drift.mjs   (also runs via `npm run validate`)
