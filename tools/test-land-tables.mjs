/**
 * The five land-travel binders — survival, foraging, searching, city travel
 * and flight — shaped into the engine tables acks-extras declares.
 *
 * Every figure and every sentence below is INVENTED. The prose is shaped like
 * the printed prose (that is the whole point: these are sentence readers), but
 * no printed duration, target, penalty, yield or rate is reproduced. Where a
 * real page says one thing, the fixture here deliberately says another — a
 * test that happened to carry the true numbers would be the book with
 * different punctuation.
 *
 * What this pins is the READING: that a count spelled out in words is found,
 * that an article before it does not defeat the match, that a die is carried
 * as a die and a flat figure as a number, that a reduction becomes the factor
 * it leaves, that a comma-separated terrain list survives, and that an
 * unbounded top row stays unbounded.
