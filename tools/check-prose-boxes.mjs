/**
 * Does every definition's description actually come from where its heading is?
 *
 * A definition's prose is printed under its own heading, so the first paragraph
 * of the block must lie in the column the anchor starts. When it does not, the
 * entry is reading whatever else prints at those coordinates: BTA p95 sets Coat,
 * Tunic and Pants and Turban beside a price list, column detection voted for the
 * list's edges, and all three shipped a column of price digits as their
 * description. Nothing said a word — the recipe was well-formed, the executor
 * found text, and the text was wrong.
 *
 * The test is one comparison per entry and needs no PDF, so it runs everywhere
 * the cookbook does. A page detection cannot read is fixed by authoring
 * `assists.columns` on the entry, which states the geometry the histogram could
 * not find; this is the check that says which entries need it.
 *
 * Two shapes are legitimately elsewhere and are not asked the question:
 *
 *  - A MONSTER prints its description beside its stat block, not beneath its
 *    name, so its prose is in the other column by design. Definitions compile
 *    into content-type cookbooks and monsters into book-keyed ones, which is
 *    the compiler's own split and so the one to read.
 *  - An ALIAS borrows its target's passage while keeping its own name probe. In
 *    the same book the two are different places on purpose, and comparing them
 *    measures the alias, not the extraction.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/check-prose-boxes.mjs   (also runs via `npm run validate`)
