/**
 * DEV-ONLY audit: which printed class-power labels does each class NOT award?
 *
 * A class spread prints its powers as run-in labels ("Expert Caving:",
 * "Renown (9th):"). Each one that the register does not name in `awards`
 * imports as nothing at all, and the omission is silent — a class missing a
 * power looks exactly like a class that has none. This lists, per class, every
 * run-in label on its own pages that no award ref accounts for.
 *
 * Structural labels (the proficiency list, the training paragraph, the
 * progression note) are expected misses and are filtered by name, as are the
 * printed labels that name something a reader PICKS or ROLLS rather than
 * something a class is granted — see `OPTIONS`. A clean run is therefore zero
 * gaps, which is what makes this runnable as a gate after a class is authored.
 *
 * IP posture as its siblings: prints labels and coordinates, never passages;
 * reads the LOCAL-ONLY reference library, never CI, stdout only.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/dev-award-scan.mjs [classKeySubstring]
