/**
 * DEV-ONLY: run ONE table recipe against the real book and report what it read.
 *
 * The recipe-authoring loop needs an answer to "did my window land where I
 * meant it to" without launching Foundry. `dev-extract-check` runs a fixed
 * sample of ENTRIES; this runs a named TABLE.
 *
 * IP posture, same as its siblings: this is a diagnostic for the authoring
 * agent and is never shipped. It prints what a window captured so the author
 * can see whether the anchor found the right paragraph — so its output is book
 * prose and MUST NOT be pasted into a repo, a commit message or a recipe. The
 * recipe stores pointers; the prose stays in the reader's own book.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/dev-try-recipe.mjs <docId> [tableKey]
