/**
 * bindEquipment ↔ the acks-extras EQUIPMENT ROOT.
 *
 * acks-extras owns that root (`equipmentClass(name)`); this test checks that
 * bindEquipment consumes it — a torch imports as a carried light
 * STACK (a bundle; it becomes a 1d4 weapon only when readied), a flask of holy
 * water as a thrown splash weapon, a lantern as a light-bearing item — and that
 * it DEGRADES to the register's own type when the module (and thus the root) is
 * absent. No RAW value is baked here; the root supplies them.
