/**
 * Module-owned compendium document content, consumed by the synced

 *
 * One pack: macros wrapping the acksImporter api, so a GM clicks instead of
 * typing console calls. Ids carry the declared "acksc" prefix and are exactly
 * 16 alphanumerics; _stats timestamps are FIXED so rebuilds are byte-identical
 * (no pack churn).
 *
 * `_id` IS IDENTITY — never change one. A new id on an existing macro gives
 * every world that already imported the pack a duplicate. Rename freely; the id
 * stays. Dropping a macro from the pack is safe the same way: worlds that
 * imported it keep their copy, which keeps working through the api. `sort`
 * orders macros WITHIN their folder and is unique per folder — two equal keys
 * render in load order, which is no order at all.

       The pack shipped twenty-one macros. Nearly all were a single step of one
       larger job, on the shelf because it happened to be a function: import
       traps, import variations, import vehicles, import rules tables, build
       template packages, fill companion slots. A Judge does not choose those
       individually — they are what "import everything" is made of, they have a
       dependency order, and a list of them invites running them in the wrong
       one.
       What is left is what a Judge actually reaches for:
         - connect your books (the prerequisite, not a control)
         - import everything
         - delete everything
         - rebuild ONE shelf
       Everything dropped is still on the api and every world that imported the
       old pack keeps its copies working, because the functions all still
       resolve. Their ids are NOT reused: an id is identity, and re-issuing one
       would hand such a world a duplicate. Folder ids likewise. */
