/**
 * `bindVariation` — turning a located variation into an acks-extras.variation.
 *
 * What this pins is the MAPPING: which located field reaches which part of the
 * schema, that a stone becomes sixths and changes sign, and that a number the
 * locator never found stays absent rather than arriving as a zero wearing the
 * book's authority. What the locators themselves read is verified against the
 * reference library, not here.
 *
 * No book text is reproduced. The values below are invented.
