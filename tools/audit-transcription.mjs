/**
 * Is a register kind shipping a LIST rather than a way to find one?
 *
 * `ip-scan` caps how LONG a shipped string may be and hunts for prose; the
 * register lint caps a label at sixty characters. Neither counts how MANY
 * short strings a kind ships, so a printed taxonomy authored one cell per
 * entry — a name in the id, a name in `name`, the same name again as the
 * anchor, and no other content — passes both cleanly. Fifty-eight of those
 * shipped once and neither gate said a word.
 *
 * The rule this enforces: an entry earns its printed name by binding a
 * MECHANIC to it. An entry whose every field is that same name is not a
 * locator for content, it IS the content, and content is read from the
 * reader's own book (see `scripts/language-binding.mjs` for the shape that
 * replaces it — a recipe of geometry, extracted at import time).
 *
 * So a kind may ship a handful of name-only entries; it may not ship a
 * catalogue of them.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/audit-transcription.mjs   (also runs via `npm run validate`)
