/**
 * Merge chef-authored recipe proposals into the register — after re-verifying
 * each one against the reference PDFs with the SHIPPING executor.
 *
 * A chef reports that its locators work. This does not take its word for it:
 * every recipe is executed here, and one that does not materialize what it
 * claims is REJECTED rather than merged. That is the whole point of a merge
 * gate — the tier below can be wrong, and its output must fail loudly instead
 * of landing quietly in shipped data.
 *
 * Nothing here sets `audited`. Merging a recipe makes an entry CORRECT;
 * signing it off is a separate human/senior act after reading the result.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/merge-recipes.mjs <book> <recipeFile> [--apply]
 *        (default is a dry run: report what would merge and what fails)
