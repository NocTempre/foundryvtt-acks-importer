/**
 * The shape imported book text takes, and the ownership test built on it.
 *
 * Three things are pinned here because each fails invisibly. Escaping: a page
 * that prints an angle bracket must not put a tag in a description field.
 * Attribution: the page reference closes the block, so it travels with the
 * words rather than living in a field beside them. And the stamp: it is the
 * ONLY thing telling a re-import "this is my writing, not the Judge's", and
 * getting that wrong means either clobbering someone's notes or never
 * repairing anything again. The live world cannot gate the third — proving it
 * there means running the update pass over every ability a world holds.
