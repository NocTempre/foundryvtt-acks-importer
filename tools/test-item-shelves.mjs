/**
 * Every id namespace the shipped cookbooks can materialize as an ITEM has a
 * shelf to land on.
 *
 * `itemShelfFor` keys on an id's first two segments and answers null for a
 * namespace it does not know, which used to mean the document was filed at the
 * top of the library with no folder at all. Nothing said so: not the importer,
 * not validate, not a test. Three namespaces drifted in that way and a live
 * world accumulated 178 items sitting loose above the shelves — priced gear,
 * races, and four conversion constants that should never have been items.
 *
 * So the shelf table is asserted against the DATA rather than against itself:
 * every namespace the cookbooks actually carry must either have a shelf or be
 * named below as something that is deliberately not an item. A new content
 * kind is then a failing test at the moment it is added, instead of a folder
 * nobody notices is missing.
 *
 * Runs over the shipped JSON with no PDFs and no Foundry, like its siblings —
 * the shelf table is duplicated here on purpose (importing `cookbook.mjs`
 * would drag in the Foundry globals), and THAT is what makes the check
 * meaningful: it fails when the two disagree.
