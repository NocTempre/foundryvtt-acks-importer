/**
 * `splitTrapTiers` — cutting a printed trap's passage into the trap and its six
 * levels.
 *
 * What this pins is the SPLITTING: where the description ends, where each level
 * begins, and what happens to a passage the rule does not fit. What a level then
 * MEANS — save or attack, which save, how far it reaches — is deliberately not
 * read here and is not tested here, because the binding does not guess it.
 *
 * No book text is reproduced. The passages below are shaped like the printed
 * ones — same ordinals, same colon, same flow into one paragraph — with
 * invented effects.
