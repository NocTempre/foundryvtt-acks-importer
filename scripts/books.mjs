/**
 * Book registry: every PDF the streamer can read, with edition fingerprints.

 *
 * A book id is a promise that connecting that PDF unlocks something. Do not add
 * one that unlocks nothing — see docs/DECISIONS.md § Withdrawn surface.
 *
 * `line` names the series a book belongs to, and is what its imports are
 * shelved under: a book declaring one goes to that line's own compendia, and a
 * book declaring none goes to the ACKS ones. Only books from outside the ACKS
 * library carry it — the ACKS line is the default, not a name in this file.

 * every book has front matter: a reader handed a raw PDF page is sent two
 * pages past what they were looking for.
