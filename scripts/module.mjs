/**
 * acks-importer — bring-your-own-book content streamer (PoC).
 *
 * POSSESSION MODEL: what persists across sessions is the LOCATION of each
 * seat's book (in IndexedDB, per seat) — never the book. Nothing is ever read
 * without the file: a session that cannot open the PDF imports nothing.
 *
 * What an import produces DOES persist, and all of it: stats, attacks, spoils
 * and the entry's own text, written into world documents by the GM who owns the
 * book, and held there like hand-entered data. Reading an imported document
 * needs no book on any seat, the importing GM's included.
 *
 * A location is a file handle, a fetchable path, or — where the browser allows
 * neither — the remembered NAME of the file, which the join-time reconnect
 * dialog offers back with a picker beside it. Same enforcement throughout;
 * only the number of clicks changes.
 *
 * A book the SERVER holds is the exception, and the reason the shelf exists: a
 * PDF staged under the Foundry data directory is recorded in world settings
 * rather than per seat, so every GM seat reads it on join with no gesture and
 * no picker. The per-seat kinds remain — they are how a book is read the first
 * time, and how its bytes reach the shelf.
 *
 * api (globalThis.acksImporter / game.modules.get("acks-importer").api):
 *   bookStatus()     the Books window: every book's state, and its control
 *   connectBook()    the same window (kept: already-imported macros call it)
 *   reconnectBooks() retry the silent reopen, then the same window
 *   browseAndLoad()  GM: pick a page, choose headings, load actors/items
 *   applyStats()     fill monster actors from the connected book
 *   forgetBooks()    drop this computer's remembered locations (not the shelf)

/**
 * A Foundry client reloads constantly — a module toggled, a macro saved, a
 * dropped connection — and on an insecure origin (any remote seat on plain
 * http, and every Firefox seat) each of those reloads used to cost the reader
 * a fresh trip through the file picker for every book they own. The location
 * was remembered; the FILE could not be reopened from it, because no browser
 * hands a picked file back from storage and the File System Access API that
 * would is absent outside a secure context.
 *
 * So the bytes are bridged across the reload, and ONLY across the reload:
 *
 *   • while a page with books open is alive it stamps the clock every 20s, and
 *     once more as it goes away;
 *   • the next page load compares that stamp against the moment IT started.
 *     Inside the window (60s by default) the cached bytes are reopened with no
 *     gesture at all — that is a refresh;
 *   • outside it, the bytes are deleted before anything else happens, and the
 *     seat goes through the normal reconnect gesture — that is a new session.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing, and the first release of this got both wrong:
 *
 *   The stamp lives in localStorage, not IndexedDB, because it is written from
 *   `pagehide` and an async IndexedDB transaction started there NEVER COMMITS —
 *   the page is torn down first. localStorage.setItem is synchronous and lands.
 *   With the async write silently lost, the freshest stamp was whatever the 20s
 *   heartbeat had last managed, which quietly ate a third of the window.
 *
 *   The comparison is against `performance.timeOrigin` — when this document
 *   started — and NOT against the time this code happens to run. Foundry takes
 *   20-45s to reach `ready` on a real world, so measuring at `ready` charged
 *   the reader's window for the boot they were sitting through, and a 60s
 *   window bought perhaps fifteen. The question the window has to answer is
 *   "how long was this seat away?", which is exactly timeOrigin minus stamp.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a copy of the book. It cannot outlive the window,
 * closing the tab for a minute empties it, and Forget Books empties it now.
 * The possession model is unchanged: a seat still cannot read a book it has
 * not opened from its own file this session, and the prose still never
 * persists anywhere.

/**
 * "Your ACKS Books" — the one window the book lives in.

 * There used to be three, and they overlapped: a Getting Started walkthrough
 * with its own "Connect a book…" button, a Connect dialog whose `<select
 * multiple>` listed every book six rows at a time, and this one, which already
 * drew a row per book with its own control. A reader could not tell from the
 * macro list which of them would show them anything, and two of the three
 * asked "which book do you mean?" in different words.
 *
 * A ROW is the answer to that question. It names one book, carries one control,
 * acts the moment it is used and says what happened — so the select is gone,
 * and with it the positional pairing that only ever existed because a
 * multi-select cannot say which file is which.
 *
 * Four bands, in the order a seat needs them:
 *
 *   1. the first-run walkthrough, open on a seat with nothing connected and
 *      collapsed once there is (it carries the GM's one-click import chain);
 *   2. the shelf — books the SERVER holds, which need no gesture from anyone;
 *   3. this computer — the controls that answer for SEVERAL books at once;
 *   4. the books themselves, grouped by what each one needs.
 *
 * The one-gesture rule shapes band 3 and 4 between them. Re-granting file
 * permission consumes the user activation that authorized it, so one click can
 * only ever unlock one handle — which is why each waiting book keeps its own
 * Unlock and why "Reconnect all" spends its single gesture on the remembered
 * FOLDER when there is one (a directory re-grants once and every book inside
 * re-reads from it) and reports honestly about the rest when there is not. A
 * plain file picker grants no persistent permission and so consumes nothing,
 * which is why "Pick PDFs…" can answer for the whole shelf at once.
