/**
 * The language taxonomy, materialized into a world from the seat's own book.
 *
 * READ AND REGISTER, not transcribe. The recipe in `table-recipes.mjs` carries
 * a heading, two x-bands and an indent step — no names — so the taxonomy is
 * extracted from the reader's own Revised Rulebook at import time and turned
 * into language items here. Nothing about which languages exist, or what each
 * descends from, is in this repo.
 *
 * That is the whole reason a language does not get one register entry apiece
 * like a power or a proficiency. Those entries anchor on a printed name
 * because they have a MECHANIC to bind to and the name is an index into it. A
 * language has no mechanic: its entry would be a name and nothing else, and
 * fifty-eight of those is not a way of finding the list, it is the list.
 *
 * The ids are derived from the extracted names at RUNTIME, in the world doing
 * the importing. A derived id is not shipped content.
 *
 * A LANGUAGE IS A `language`, NOT AN ABILITY. The system owns the type — it
 * declares it, gives it an icon and a details template, files it in its own
 * section of the character sheet, and reads it in the Polyglot provider it
 * registers (`getUserLanguages` scans an actor for `type === "language"` and
 * nothing else). Minting abilities here put every imported tongue outside all
 * of that at once.
 *
 * FIND BEFORE MINTING. The world may already hold the tongue — under its
 * derived id from a previous import, under a name a Judge typed, or as the
 * system compendium's own document. Each is adopted in that order and stamped
 * with the derived id, so re-importing converges on ONE document per language
 * instead of laying a fresh twin beside every one that was already there.
