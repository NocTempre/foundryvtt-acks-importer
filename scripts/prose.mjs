/**
 * The shape imported book text takes in a world document.

 * An import materializes the entry's own paragraphs into the document it
 * creates, with the page reference as the closing line, and the world holds
 * them from then on. Nothing is resolved again at render time and no seat but
 * the importing GM's ever needs the book.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **The text is escaped, never parsed.** Extracted PDF text is plain text
 *    that happens to be about to live in an HTML field; an angle bracket in a
 *    printed formula is a character, not a tag.
 *  - **The wrapper is stamped** (`data-acks-entry`). That is what lets a later
 *    pass tell text this module wrote from text a Judge wrote over it, so a
 *    re-import replaces its own work and never someone else's.
