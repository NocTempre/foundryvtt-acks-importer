 * run, in WHAT order, and how a failure in one is kept from silencing the rest.

 * The GM chain, in dependency order — every importer the module ships, in the

 *
 *  1. abilities   — proficiencies, powers and skills; everything below resolves
 *                   its ability tokens against these shared items;
 *  2. equipment   — the shop list, the weapon and armour grids, and the animals;
 *  3. classes     — a class's proficiency awards and starting kit are refs into
 *                   the two above, so a class imported first points at nothing;
 *  4. monsters    — resolve their ability tokens against 1;
 *  5. companions  — an ability's companion slot points at a creature, and
 *                   abilities were imported before any creature existed, so the
 *                   link can only be made once 4 has run;
 *  6. journals + roll tables — reference the creatures imported in 4;
 *  7. rules tables — last (they warn by themselves if the provider is absent).
 *
 * A step missing from this list is a step a GM can only reach by hunting for
 * its macro — which is how the class import came to be run by hand, repeatedly.
 * Each step is idempotent and reports through its own notifications; this only
 * sequences them and narrates which one is running.
