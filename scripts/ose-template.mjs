/**
 * A creature the book stats across a RANGE becomes a generator, not a creature.
 *
 * Some entries are not one monster. "HD 3** to 8** (13/18/22/27/31/36hp),
 * THAC0 By HD (17 [+2] to 12 [+7])" describes six creatures sharing everything
 * except their hit dice, and the Referee's Tome prints eleven of them. Read as
 * a single block each one arrives as the WEAKEST member of its own kind and the
 * rest of the range is gone — no gap, no note, just a three-hit-dice ankheg.
 *
 * The family already has the right document for this: `acks-extras.template`,
 * an actor whose axes carry engine-ready patches and which stamps out concrete
 * creatures on demand. It was built for the Monstrous Manual's four
 * varies-by-rank entries; a varies-by-hit-dice entry is the same shape, so this
 * builds one rather than inventing a second mechanism.
 *
 * WHAT IS PRINTED AND WHAT IS NOT. Each step's hit points are printed — either
 * one figure per step or a rate per hit die — and are transcribed. The attack
 * throw is printed only at the two ENDS of the range, so the steps between are
 * filled only when the arithmetic proves itself: the bonus must advance evenly
 * across the range, which is the book's own table restricted to these rows. It
 * does not divide evenly, the middle of the range says nothing and the option
 * carries no throw at all. Nothing here interpolates on faith.
